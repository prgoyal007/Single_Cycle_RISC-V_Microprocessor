# Single_Cycle_RISC-V_Microprocessor

# Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a Single-Cycle RISC-V Microprocessor in Verilog, following a modular hardware design approach. The processor supports a subset of RISC-V instructions and includes key components such as the Datapath, Controller, ALU Controller, Register File, Memory Modules, and Multiplexers. The design was simulated and verified using Xilinx Vivado, ensuring correct instruction execution throughout waveform analysis. 

# Project Features
Processor Development:
- Designed and implemented a Single-Cycle RISC-V processor in Verilog, ensuring correct execution of fundamental arithmetic, logical, memory, and control flow instructions.
- Developed an instruction execution pipeline using modular sub-components that interact seamlessly.

Datapath Implementation:
- Built a fully functional datapath that integrates:
- Program Counter (PC): Fetches instructions sequentially.
-
